# Waves
This mini-game was my first attempt at creating a game from scratch. Waves was made following a youtube tutorial by 'RealTutsGML'.

# Gameplay
Waves is a clasic wave survival game. You control your character (the white square) with WASD and attempt to dodge the enimies. You're health is displayed in the top right. There are two bosses and surviving them awards you more health. There is a simple score mechanism based on the total time you survive.

# Idea 
I decided to follow this tutorial as it starts completely from scratch. Even the game loop is written from scratch. I thought it would be a good intro into game design.
I plan to continue making small games and I'm working through my little stash of game development books and guides. I am currently working through "Beginning Java Game Development with libGDX".
